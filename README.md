# symmetry-deviation
Symmetry is an app written in java for the National Science Foundation Center For Novel High
Voltage/Temperature Materials and Structures.
## About
This program calculates and displays the deviation of glass fragments from glass tubes under pressure being shot by a pneumatic air rifle. The program determines the position and velocity of the fragments over time and generates a symmetrical deviation plot comparing the blast profile to a perfect circle.
## Running
From a terminal go to test directory and run "java -jar Symmetry.jar sample1.svg test.dat".
